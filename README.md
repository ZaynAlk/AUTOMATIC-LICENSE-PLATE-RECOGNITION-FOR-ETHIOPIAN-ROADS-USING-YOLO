# AUTOMATIC-LICENSE-PLATE-RECOGNITION-FOR-ETHIOPIAN-ROADS-USING-YOLO

This repository contains a method to detect  and recognize Ethiopian license plates as a representation of vehicle presence in an image. We have utilized You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLO v3&v4) to detect the plates inside an input image. The method has the advantages of high accuracy and real-time performance, thanks to YOLO v3  and v4 architecture. The presented system receives a series of vehicle images and produces the processed image with added bounding-boxes containing the vehicles' license plates. The flow of how we have trained and tested the application is published on medium([links](https://medium.com/@zeynualkadir/automatic-license-plate-recognition-for-ethiopian-roads-using-yolo-14d9f4ada353)) you can read the article.

If you want to test the already trained file you can use my_data folder all the trained weights for both yolov3 and yolov4 had it in case of license plate detection and recognition.
all the weight files which are trained by me can find in yolo-utils folder.
you can add new or your custom dataset  test images for detection in detectiontestpic folder, or you can use my own test images which are found in the folder. 
I separate the code in real-time and not real-time which means if you run real-time code you can use  it for videos however if you run  non-real-time code you can only use it for images 
after that you can test the images by running the python file  on jupytr  I have already uploaded the necessary file to test the detection and the recognition. 
for testing in real-time on videos use the google colab python file which I mention in the next part.
starting training from scratch 
if you want to train from scratch which lets you use another version of Yolo use the google collab with the uploaded datasets, I already uploaded  labeled datasets with corresponding  images  for both  the detection and recognition steps  in a zip file and change all Yolo version codes to use in  specific yolo version.
use the uploaded Google_colob file "Google_colab_plate_detection_YOLOv3&v4_Custom_Object_Detection" and "Google_colab_plate_recognition_YOLOv3&v4_Custom_Object_Detection", by opening this file on google colab you can run the code and use it to train the custom dataset or new version of yolo.
you can test real-time videos for Ethiopian license plate detection by running the below code which finds in â€¦ file 

./darknet detector demo data/obj.data cfg/yolov3_detection_training.cfg data/yolov3_detection_training_last.weights -dont_show data/img-3.MOV -out_filename img-3result.MOV

Due to the size of the file I uploaded  to my google drive, you can get all the necessary files here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jm0AfD2Mtml09KgMNrZSbhjRMAjhwK-a/view?usp=drive_link
I hope this can help you to detect and recognizes Ethiopian license plates.
